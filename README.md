    <h1>Portfolio Website - README</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This repository was intended to serve as the foundation for my personal portfolio website, where I planned to showcase my projects, skills, and experiences. The project was started over 9 months ago, but progress was paused due to the need for more quality projects to feature on the site.</p>
    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>The project is currently on hiatus. While the basic structure was laid out, I decided to put development on hold until I have more completed projects that accurately represent my skills and expertise. The plan is to revisit and continue building the portfolio once I have accumulated a sufficient number of showcase-worthy projects.</p>
    <h2>Technologies Planned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML/CSS:</strong> For creating the structure and styling of the website.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> To add interactivity and dynamic features.</li>
        <li><strong>React:</strong> Considered for building the user interface components.</li>
        <li><strong>Flask:</strong> Potential backend technology for handling contact forms or other server-side logic.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p>Once I have more projects to showcase, I intend to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Resume development of this portfolio site.</li>
        <li>Implement responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.</li>
        <li>Add sections for projects, skills, experience, and a contact form.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Run the Project (if applicable)</h2>
    <p>For now, the repository only contains initial setup files. If you want to view the current state of the project:</p>
